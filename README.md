## Description
This web app is a simple (work day) calendar that allows users to schedule, edit and delete events while saving them in local storage. The time is tracked along the calendar showing present and future blocks of time by color and disabling past blocks from new inputs. The app sets the day/time using moment.js and displays current weekday, date and time in the heading.

**Challenges**  
One of the biggest challenges in writing this app was trying to grab the data I needed. I had to get creative, chaining together JQuery methods like *.closest()* and *.find()* in order to get to the objects and elements I wanted to manipulate.

**v0.1.0**


**Future Versions**
* Clear the local storage at a certain time every day so that the user can start out with an empty schedule to fill
* Add some kind of alert when the user has entered a value in the schedule but not hit the "update" button
* Get the analog clock face working properly so that it moves and displays the actual time
